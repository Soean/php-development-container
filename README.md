## Write a script that outputs the numbers from 1 to 15.

- If the number is a multiple of 3, you need to print "Par" instead of that number.
- If the number is a multiple of 5, you need to print "Ship" instead of that number.
- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, you need to print "Parship" instead of that number.
